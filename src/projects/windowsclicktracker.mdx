I joined a coding bootcamp which teached about web development. Subject that I did not now much about since at school courses was more focused on C++ and games.

In the bootcamp we had to create a demo of some sort. So recently I had my mouse start to double-click which probably caused me to get this idea of a click tracking software.
And because it was a web development bootcamp, I came up with the idea to have the stats to be displayed from a webpage instead of inside application in Windows.

So the ClickTracker consists of a C# WPF application for Windows, a .NET Web API 2.0 and a React webpage.
In the video can be seen clicktracker in action, I am hosting for myself the API and a database in Azure.
