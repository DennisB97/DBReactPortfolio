I entered the Epic Games MegaJam 2022, which was a competition to create a game in a week.

The theme of the jam was "as above so below", so I came up with the idea to create a VR escape room that contains a room which is mirrored below to fit the theme.
I used only some free art assets and audio and music, the rest was done by me.
The core systems and interactions seen in the video were created in C++, and then for example the gameplay loop connecting everything together was just dirty made quickly in the level blueprint.
