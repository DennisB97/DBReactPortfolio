This was made for a OpenGL and a networking course at school. 
Uses FreeGLUT and GLEW to setup OpenGL and uses unserialized data so char characters over Winsock for the simple networking.

First in thevideo you see pathfinding used for the purple knob to find the point to pickup while myself the blue knob is moved by keyboard.
After this the networking is shown, a connection over the local IP is made and connecting two games.
