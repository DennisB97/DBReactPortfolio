videoTitle: "Vulkan simple rendering"

This was done on my free time, mainly learning more about Vulkan. 
This uses libraries like Vulkan memory allocator, dear imgui, glm and gltf for mesh loading.

Here in this video a skybox and some meshes are rendered using Vulkan API and using a simple UI created with dear imgui to toggle wireframe and hide meshes.
The textures and colors might be slightly off since I was trying to understand PBR and copying some common PBR shader code and didn't quit get it to work properly.
