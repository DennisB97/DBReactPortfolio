videoTitle: "UE4 Blueprint prototype Dice Game"
---

This was done for a school course, I had some help from a classmate who added sound and other stuff.
I did the dice rolling, enemy wave appearing and created a simple scene for the game from free assets. 
I also combined the animations and attacks for the sample characters from Epic Games' free assets.

In the video you will see the dice being thrown and a result of the dices thrown an enemy wave will begin, as it was just a little prototype,
the transitioning is only happening by switching cameras in the same scene. And everything was done with Blueprints.
