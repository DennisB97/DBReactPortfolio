This is my current free time project, I'm hoping to actually finish this project at some point.
So that it won't just become a prototype. I am using C++ in UE4 and I am creating this for Oculus Quest & Quest 2 devices, as I do own a Quest to debug with.
I use my expertise so far with UE4 to create something that I feel is fun.

Currently I have class that creates a grid based on the user's play-area, 
then I got another thread which generates spline points within the grid. This spline is then used to create a procedural mesh, because the performance is a lot better with procedural mesh rather than the spline meshes. Performance is key on mobile hardware.
