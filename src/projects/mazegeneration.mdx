This was some prototyping on my free time, and perhaps to become something in the future when I have time to work on it more.
C++ classes handling thread creation and running the depth-first algorithm, 
also creating some elevator shafts with splines and the tunnel leading to the maze with splines.

In the video you can see the maze generation in action.
Additional exposed variables can be configured from the blueprint and modify how the maze will be generated.
