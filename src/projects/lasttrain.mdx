videoTitle: "What I did for Last Train Unity VR project"
---


This Unity VR project was done with a group of exchange students in Nagoya, Japan.
The group consisted of myself and two other Finns, three Singaporean and two Japanese.
The project was done in Unity, and was my first time using Unity and C#.

In the video you can see the functionality of some things that I created into the project.
